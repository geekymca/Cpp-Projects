# C++ Course Final Project - BusterGhost
This is the final project in the second introductory C++ course.

The included `summary.txt` file is an excerpt from the document submitted
along with the project for grading purposes.

It includes some additional background information about the game's story.

This project was written very early on in the program, and is not really an optimal approach to presenting a text-based game. Knowing what I know now, I'd change the textual descriptions for each room to be read in from files to facilitate editing and make the logic easier to follow. The primary issue with such an approach would be players spoiling themselves by reading the text files, which could be worked around with some obfuscation but I'm not a big fan of obfuscation.
